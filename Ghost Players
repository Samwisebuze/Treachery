Once a player dies, what do they do?

If a player dies (which can happen before they haunt) they become a ghost. 
  As a ghost, they leave their body and enter a spectate mode. 
  -They are invisible to everyone
  -Can fly (to an extent) 
  -Cannot pass through walls by default
  -Cannot explore new rooms or open new doors
  -Potentially have some fun effects (i.e. haunted confetti, spoopy transformation, etc...). 
 
 
 Other Potential Mechanics
  -Will vary depending on the haunt that occurs
  -Ghosts can be used as triggers for haunts (ex. Poltergeist)
  -Ghost mechanics can change depending on haunts (i.e. Ring Haunt: Dead heros can help their friends search for the traitor)
  -Ghost mechanics can be changed by haunts (i.e. Fiddlerâ€™s song reincarnating insane heroes to fight for him)
  -Haunts have to account for current ghost players when the haunt starts.
Customization (of player and ghost...)?
  -To be determined


Determining of whether or not ghost players should be an in-game mechanic...
  Pros (fuller story, more mechanics)
    -No *total* player elimination
      -Death is no longer a *huge* penalty
    -More in-depth and logical story
    -More varied and ingenuitive mechanics
    -Differentiates the game, making this mechanic *unique* compared to other games of its type
  Cons (Longer/harder development, more mechanics)
    -More complexity
    -More rules (heroes)
    -More lore to write/create
    -Higher chance of error
    -More models to develop
