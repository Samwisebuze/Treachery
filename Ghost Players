Once a player dies, what do they do?

If a player dies (which can happen before they haunt) they become a ghost. 
  As a ghost, they leave their body and enter a spectate mode. 
  -They are invisible to everyone
  -Can fly (to an extent) 
  -Cannot pass through walls by default
  -Cannot explore new rooms or open new doors
  -Potentially have some fun effects (i.e. haunted confetti, spoopy transformation, etc...). 
 
 Other Potential Mechanics
  -Will vary depending on the haunt that occurs
  -Ghosts can be used as triggers for haunts (ex. Poltergeist)
  -Ghost mechanics can change depending on haunts (i.e. Ring Haunt: Dead heros can help their friends search for the traitor)
  -Ghost mechanics can be changed by haunts (i.e. Fiddlerâ€™s song reincarnating insane heroes to fight for him)
  -Haunts have to account for current ghost players when the haunt starts.
Customization (of player and ghost...)?
  -To be determined
